# CCER

Migrating legacy software systems to the cloud has reached the main-stream and over the decade many legacy software systems have been migrated from in-house infrastructure to cloud platforms. An indication of the wide-spread cloud migration is the growing published research works, experience re-ports, and practitionersâ€™ weblogs related to this topic. Capturing and packing the past experiences and lessons learned in cloud migration projects is essential for reusing in further scenarios, avoiding pitfalls, and alleviating information over-load. Inspired by the idea of the evidence-based software engineering (EBSE), we have developed a central knowledge base platform, called CloudCompu-tingExperienceRepository (CCER). CCER shifts the cloud migration from a tentative and ad-hoc way knowledge sharing to a systematic evidence-based approach. It can be incorporated into the legacy system migration process en-deavors, particularly useful for system architects, to provide a foundation for in-formed decision makings. We illustrate the application of CCER in a case study of migrating a legacy manufacturing system to data analytics platforms. Find-ings and recommendations of domain experts in implementing cloud-specific knowledge base platforms are also reported.
